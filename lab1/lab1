This data was collected from the census bureau database to predict whether a person's income is over 50k or not. Each record in the database represents one person in the survey. Data mining tries to find the relations between the data and make the prediction based on those relations. Marital status may also be predicted based on these data. I may calculate a new ordinary variable using the age and the income and find its relation to marital status.  If the model or the algorithm derived from the training data is able to predict the test data (or other samples), we can tell we have mined useful data.
